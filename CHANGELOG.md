# 5.4.0
#### Notes
Extends support of the SDK to OneView REST API version 2000 (OneView v5.40).

#### Breaking Changes
  Enhancement made in this version breaks the previous version of the SDK.
  From this version onwards, hpOneView module name is renamed to hpeOneView and all the oneview libraries and examples will import the hpeOneView module as parent.

  E.g.
```
       from hpeOneView.oneview_client import OneViewClient
       oneview_client = OneViewClient(config)              # Create OneView client
       fc_networks = oneview_client.fc_networks            # Get FCNetowrk resource client
```

#### Major changes
- Refactored base class to take default API version as per provided Oneview appliance.
- Removed provision of "type" field as those are optional from API1600.
- Added support for automatic publish of Docker Image when there is a new release in GitHub

#### Features supported
- Certificates Server
- Hypervisor Cluster Profiles
- Hypervisor Managers

# 5.0.0
#### Notes
Extends support of the SDK to OneView REST API version 1200 (OneView v5.00).

#### Major changes
 1. Extending support of the SDK to API version 1200.
 2. Refactored base classes to make resource data available with the resource object.
    This will help to add more helper methods for the resources and hide data complexity from the user.
 3. Introduced mixin classes to include the optional features of the resources.
 4. Added below methods for all the resources by introducing a base class for the resource client classes.
    Appropriate exception will be raised, if any of the features are not available for a resource.
    
    | Method              | Returns                                       |
    | ------------------  | --------------------------------------------- |
    | create              |   resource object                             |
    | update              |   resource object                             |
    | delete              |   boolean                                     |
    | get_all             |   list of resource data                       |
    | get_by_name         |   resource object                             |
    | get_by_uri          |   resource object                             |
    | get_by              |   resource data                               |
    
#### Breaking
  Enhancement made in this version breaks the previous version of the SDK.
  From this version onwards, create/update/get_by_name/get_by_uri will return an object of the resource instead of data.

  E.g.
```
       oneview_client = OneViewClient(config)              # Create OneView client
       fc_networks = oneview_client.fc_networks            # Get FCNetowrk resource client
       fc_network = fc_networks.get_by_name(name) / create # Get an existing FCNetwork's object by it's name or create one
       fc_network.update(update_data)                      # Update FCNetwork
       fc_network.delete()                                 # Delete FCNetwork
```
