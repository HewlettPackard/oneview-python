    The server profile template resource provides methods to create, retrieve, modify, and delete server
    profile templates.

    A server profile template serves as a structural reference when creating a server profile.
    All of the configuration constructs of a server profile are present in the server profile template.
    The server profile template serves as the initial and ongoing reference for the structure of a server profile.
    The server profile template defines the centralized source for the configuration of firmware, connections,
    local storage, SAN storage, boot, BIOS, profile affinity and hide unused flexNICs.

    After being created from a server profile template, the server profile continues to maintain an association to its
    server profile template. Any drift in configuration consistency between the server profile template and server
    profile(s) is monitored and made visible on both the server profile template and the associated server profile(s).

        Gets a list of server profile templates based on optional sorting and filtering and is constrained by start and

            start: The first item to return, using 0-based indexing. If not specified, the default
                is 0 - start with the first available item.
            count: The number of resources to return. Providing a -1 for the count parameter will restrict
                the result set size to 64 server profile templates. The maximum number of profile templates
                is restricted to 256, that is, if user requests more than 256, this will be internally limited to 256.

                serialNumberType, status, serverHardwareTypeUri, enclosureGroupUri, and firmware.firmwareBaselineUri attributes.
            sort: The sort order of the returned data set. By default, the sort order is based
                on create time with the oldest entry first.
            scope_uris: An expression to restrict the resources returned according to the scopes to which they are assigned.
